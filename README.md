# LED Matrix display using arduino

In this project, we will learn about LED Matrix Displays and two different projects on Arduino 8×8 LED Matrix Interface. 
The first project will be a simple interface between Arduino and 8X8 LED Matrix to display information (even scrolling 
information and images can be displayed) and the second project will be an advanced project where the 8×8 LED Matrix is 
controlled through an Android device.

An LED matrix is a two dimensional array of LEDs that can be used to display symbols, characters or even images. Based 
on the orientation of the LEDs in the matrix, there can be two types of LED matrices.They are Common Row Anode and Common
Row Cathode.

LED matrix modules are one of the commonly used display devices and are used in major applications like electronic display
panels and notification systems.
